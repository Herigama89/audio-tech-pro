# Riff: a Logic-style DAW

A native DAW in C++20 + JUCE 8. Phase 0 is complete. It has a multitrack
arrange view, an undoable project model, saving and opening projects, and a
real-time engine that never blocks the audio thread.

## Build and run

### macOS

Run these one at a time, without the comment lines:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja
cd riff
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
open build/Riff_artefacts/Debug/Riff.app
```

- The first configure downloads JUCE and Catch2, which takes a few minutes.
- After you change code, you only need `cmake --build build` again.

### Windows (Visual Studio 2022 with "Desktop development with C++")

```bat
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug
build\Riff_artefacts\Debug\Riff.exe
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build git libasound2-dev libjack-jackd2-dev \
  libfreetype-dev libfontconfig1-dev libx11-dev libxcomposite-dev libxcursor-dev \
  libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxrender-dev
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
./build/Riff_artefacts/Debug/Riff
```

## Tests

```bash
cmake --build build --target RiffTests
./build/RiffTests_artefacts/Debug/RiffTests
```

The tests cover:

- **Model:** tracks and regions, undo and redo, move, split, trim, and the JSON round trip.
- **Engine:** sample-accurate region placement, source offsets, mute, solo, volume, pan, resampling alignment, and swapping graphs mid-playback.

## Using it

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Add audio | Drag files from Finder onto a track, or onto empty space for a new track. Or use **Import** (Cmd+I) to place them at the playhead. |
| Play / stop | Space |
| Go to start | Return |
| Move the playhead | Click or drag in the ruler |
| Move a region | Drag it, including onto another track. It snaps to the grid; hold Cmd to move freely. |
| Trim a region | Drag its left or right edge |
| Split | Cmd+T splits at the playhead (the selected region, or every region under the playhead on the selected track) |
| Delete a region | Select it and press Delete, or right-click it |
| Undo / redo | Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z |
| Zoom | Cmd+scroll, or Cmd+Left / Cmd+Right |
| Scroll | Trackpad, the scroll wheel (with Shift to go sideways), or the scroll bars |
| Track controls | Name (double-click to rename), **M**ute, **S**olo, volume, pan. Right-click a track for Delete. |
| Tempo | Double-click the BPM value. The ruler and grid follow it. |
| Save / open | Cmd+S, Cmd+Shift+S, Cmd+O. Projects are `.riff` files. |

Projects store audio paths relative to the `.riff` file. If you keep the audio
next to the project, you can move the folder and it still opens.

## Code layout

```

    Identifiers.h         names used in the project tree

```

### How an edit reaches your speakers

1. A view calls a function in `model::` with the `UndoManager`, for example `moveRegion`.
2. The project tree changes. Every listener updates: the views repaint and `ProjectPlayer` schedules a rebuild.
3. `ProjectPlayer` builds a new `PlaybackGraph`, converting seconds to samples and attaching decoded audio from the cache.
4. `AudioEngine::setGraph` swaps it in with one atomic pointer exchange. The audio thread picks it up at its next block.
5. The old graph is freed on the message thread once the audio thread has finished with it.

## Next: Phase 1, record and arrange

- [ ] Record-arm on tracks, and record from the interface into new regions
- [ ] Disk streaming for long files, instead of loading whole files into memory
- [ ] Recording latency compensation and a loopback calibration test
- [ ] Cycle (loop) region in the ruler, and cycle recording into take lanes
- [ ] Project folder with an `Audio Files/` subfolder for recordings
